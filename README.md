# DataVis_CourseWork
Graphics I completed for my Data Visualization course at the University of Chicago.

### Class Final Project
A graphic which illustrates the August birth penalty. (This is the phenomenon that August-born
students underperform academically, likely due to the fact that school enrollment policies
lead them to be the youngest in their grade.):

My replica is here:

(Data is from the Census. This takes about ten seconds to load.)

### Tom Brady Charts
I replicated the chart showing quarterback playoff wins from this article:

My chart showing playoff wins by year is here:
